Her performance in the movie is not only commendable, but it makes an average love story appealing and fun.\r\n\r\nThe movie revolves around Muna (Shristi Shrestha) and Ved (Vinay Shrestha) who have living different lives in different corners of the world. Muna is an independent girl who stays away from her family. Ved is a rich spoilt brat who is a womaniser. Both meet in Dharan when Vedâ€™s mother asks him to go there to see a girl she has selected for him. Both of them are stubborn and end up making a stupid bet which changes the lives of both forever.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the movie is quite enjoyable as it keeps you hooked with its good story line and funny dialogues. The chemistry between Shristi and Vinay stands out as both look very natural and good together. Apart from some scenes with Sushma Karki, the half is good as it flies by.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the film is not as good because a lot happens in it. Itâ€™s a bit slow and as the first half is full of jokes, this one tends to be a bit serious which has made the film a bit intense.

(27, 'Sports', 'World Cup VAR: Technology is transforming the beautiful game', 'var-controversy.jpg', 'VAR is already proving controversial at this yearâ€™s World Cup. EPA/ Yuri Kocketkov\r\nYou may have noticed something different in the 2018 World Cup. For the first time ever, the Virtual Assistant Referee (VAR) system is being used to help make decisions during games. And already we are seeing it cause controversy.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s no surprise that VAR has caused debate, considering the furor that surrounded VAR in the English FA Cup and the Bundesliga. But although VAR receives huge attention, we should not forget that it is only the most visible example of the digitalisation of football, where data and technology is used to improve performance and decision-making. And digitisation is already transforming the game of football. But it is also leading many people to fear that the game is changing too fast and leaving fans behind.\r\n\r\nDecision Making On The Field?\r\nVAR is a form of technology that is supposed to help referees make near-accurate decisions. As the game progresses, assistant referees away from the stadium watch instant replays of incidents. Over wireless headsets, they communicate with the referee, advising them on any game-changing incident. VAR is supposed to only assist referees in four main areas: goals, penalties, red cards and mistaken identity. But ultimately, the referee still has the final decision.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, VAR was introduced into the FA Cup for the first time. It was quickly blamed for ruining â€œthe beautiful gameâ€, by players and managers alike. Specific matches, especially between Tottenham and Rochdale in the FA Cup quarter final, caused particular ire after a Tottenham goal was reversed by VAR for reasons that were unclear.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were remarkable scenes in the Bundesliga also. At half time, during a game between Mainz 05 and SC Freiburg, the teams were ordered back onto the pitch so that a retrospective penalty could be given after a VAR decision. Fans and players alike were less than happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAR has already made its mark on this yearâ€™s World Cup. Although it has received positive feedback by some, it continues to cause intense debate. The technology was criticised for not flagging a penalty that allowed Switzerland to score against Brazil. And others criticised its role in the awarding of a French penalty against Australia. Many England fans also questioned the technology when the referee did not award a penalty after Harry Kane was wrestled to the ground by Tunisiaâ€™s Ferjani Sassi twice. Yet Tunisia scored on a penalty given for a similar foul.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this push not count as a foul?\r\nThe â€˜Digitalisationâ€™ Of Football\r\nOver the last few decades, it feels as if every aspect of life has been touched by â€œdigitalisationâ€. And it has had a major impact in nearly every aspect of football. Whether it be TV coverage, ticketing or, perhaps most revolutionary of all, its capacity for teams to analyse and measure performance.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedented amount of data and information, that is produced through the Internet of Things, objects that are connected to the internet, enables better customised training. Teams can now collect enormous amount of data on how individual sports men and women perform in training and in actual matches. Coaches can use this data to give incredibly personalised feedback. It can also enable managers to make tactical decisions based upon live data, such as how far someone has run, where on the pitch they have been playing, and how many passes they have made, during the game. The future of football might be one in which teams are picked and play in a certain way â€œbecause of what the data saysâ€.\r\n\r\nDigitalisation is one of the major reasons why sport has transformed from a game played for entertainment and leisure into an industry worth over 1.5 trillion US$ globally. You only need to look at eSports, now a $400m industry, to see how digitalised sport has become.\r\n\r\n\r\neSports is growing. EPA/Marton Monus\r\nBut with VAR, many feel that digitalisation has gone a step too far and made football feel unnatural. There is something strange when fans have to hold off celebrating a goal until they receive confirmation from VAR. Many sports, particularly football, have a rich and symbolic heritage which some see as being under threat due to digitalisation. And it is not going to stop, with the Internet of Things, virtual reality and augmented reality increasingly being used in training grounds.\r\n\r\nVAR might be getting the decision right (or not) and digitalisation might be making football more lucrative while improving the performance of players and the tactics of managers. But such â€œprogressâ€ also threatens to hamper the excitement and the spirit of the game. The fear is that as the relentless progress of technology continues, football might just lose the magic that made it so special.\r\n\r\n', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-02 21:48:19'),
(32, 'Slider', 'French Bakery review: More than just a staggering sandwich', 'French-Bakery-Sandwich.jpg', 'Even since France won the World Cup, I have had the urge to eat at a French place. Having visited two French restaurants in Kathmandu already, I was looking for another one and in the process, I stumbled across French Bakery. Located at Paknajol, the place is a little hard to find, but is one that is worth a visit.\r\n\r\nThe brains behind the place is Buddha Shrestha, who has been working in the food industry for the past 25 years. Having worked at French restaurants in multiple countries and polished his skills in Australia, Shrestha decided to open a bakery that served offered his patrons something different.\r\n\r\nAs Nepal lacked quality bakeries he opened one which was hygienic and served things that were not available in Kathmandu. After coming back from Australia, he opened a bakery at Mhehpi near Naya Bazaar in 2014. After the place gained some popularity, he decided to open one at Paknajol in 2015, which served as both a bakery and a cafÃ©.\r\n\r\nIn the three years of operation, the place has been doing quite well catering both foreigners and Nepali customers. What makes the place a bit different to other sandwich places is that it brings a lot of items from abroad which enhances the taste of the items they prepare at the bakery. For example, the flour for the bread is brought all the way from Italy and some spices and cheese are imported from Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I was here to try the one item that French Bakery is famous for â€“ the staggering crispy chicken sandwich. Like the name, the dish is quite staggering and overwhelming. Most sandwiches we get here in Nepal include two slices of bread (either normal bread or sandwich bread) with chicken, lettuce, cheese or vegetables in between but this one was quite different. Instead of using a normal bread, Shrestha uses his own tender cylindrical bread.\r\n\r\nInside the bread, he puts in a lot of ingredients and you can choose what goes inside. Around six-inch-long hollow space in the bread makes room for the dressing, cheese and the delicious crispy chicken. If you want, you can pick and choose what goes in it. I opted for their normal sandwich which was standing tall on a wooden platter with a side of fried potatoes and coleslaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaggering crispy chicken sandwich\r\nFor a brief moment, I had to think about how to eat it but after careful planning, it wasnâ€™t hard. Before indulging in the massive sandwich, I nibbled on a few pieces of chicken which were quite flavourful and tender with the right amount of crunchiness.\r\n\r\nThe stuffing in the sandwich, especially the dressing and the cheese, complimented both the bread and the chicken as it did not make the dish too dry. The potatoes deep fried with ginger, garlic and herbs gave it a distinctly unique flavour. I recommend you take someone with you to try the dish as I do not think a single person can eat the entire sandwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nBakery items for sale at the French Bakery\r\nThe place also offers various French, Australian and other European dishes along with some scrumptious bakery items amongst which I hear the chocolate truffle cake is the most famous along with their unique black forest cheesecake which one can order for events as well.\r\n\r\nShrestha adds that he wants everything the restaurant serves to be available to the general public which makes the place quite unique. The place sells items like vegemite and marmite, items famous in Australia and the UK respectively. They also offer a full vegan menu.\r\n\r\nFrench Bakery also has a lot of French and Australian items one can buy. From French and Australian wines to Australian spices, they have items that most departmental stores do not have.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the place is worth a visit especially for its warm atmosphere and their staggering sandwich. The place is open all day which makes it an ideal place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\r\n\r\n', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-03 04:50:03'),
(33, 'Slider', 'Ant-Man and The Wasp movie review: Wasp overshadows Ant-Man in new Marvel flick', 'Antman.jpg', 'alert(&#39;hacked&#39;);Apart from some big banner Hindi films, superhero movies are the ones which attract a lot of moviegoers in Nepal. After the success of Avengers: Infinity War, the Marvel Comic Universe (MCU) has come up with another movie which has been based on incidents before Thanos killed everyone.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) grappling with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father. Heâ€™s under house arrest after his shenanigans in Germany (Captain America: Civil War), Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), cut ties with him because Lang didnâ€™t inform them before going rogue with Captain America. But Lang is soon approached by Hope van Dyne and Dr Hank Pym, as he once again dons the Ant-Man suit to fight alongside them. The urgent mission soon leads to secret revelations from the past as the dynamic duo finds itself in an epic battle against a powerful new enemy, Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the movie gives a recap of what had happened in the first Ant-Man movie and Captain America: Civil War. Slowly the story starts building up as Ant-Man and The Wasp go on a little adventure together. The second half is more intense as it involves one of the most epic car chases in recent times.\r\n\r\nWhile most sequels fail to live up to the hype that the first movie creates, this one, however, is far better than the first one. It is funnier; it is much more charming and is more memorable than its first part. This movie is as funny as Deadpool as it makes you giggle throughout the film like in that scene where Ant-Man has to retrieve an object but canâ€™t due to his malfunctioning shifting abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReed in this movie is just as good as he was in the first. He hasnâ€™t changed much from his natural performance in the hit TV show FRIENDS. He is mature and funny and knows what to say and when as the script has given him the liberty to flex his comedic muscles like when he uses a lorry as a skateboard.\r\n\r\nEvangeline is really great in the action scenes which are better than Reed as she has pulled off some really good stunts like her first fight scene with the bad guys. She has taken centre stage in the film where she does all of Reedâ€™s dirty works.\r\n\r\nDouglas as her dad is as funny as Reed as he cracks some really funny jokes time and again. His acting is just as good especially his emotional moment with his wife is intense. Another actor that stands out is Michael Pena who has done a really good job as Reedâ€™s accomplice. Hannah John-Kamen is good as the antagonist as she has done justice in her role.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is quite good but itâ€™s nothing compared to the other MCU movies. There are a few scenes which are quite good like the car chase where the cars shift shapes like a video game which makes for an intense watch.\r\n\r\nWhat is most likable in the film is the script which goes with a gradual flow connecting one movie to another. Its explained why Ant-Man was missing during the chaos happening in Infinity Wars.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an enjoyable watch which is set up really nicely leading up to the next Avengers film where we will get to see how Ant-Man is going to face Thanos and help the Avengers beat him.', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-03 04:51:53'),
(34, 'Blog', 'Upper Mustang: Dangerous roads lead to beautiful places', 'Pataleban-Vineyard-Winery-1.jpg', '<p style=\'text-align:justify\'>When Kumar Karki (46), like thousands of Nepalis who go abroad in search of a better future, left for Japan in 2000, he had a wish to come back and do something different.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting vineyards in Japan and watching them use technology to produce grape, he decided to do the same in Nepal. Along with a vineyard, he also wanted to open a resortâ€“doing so was was one of his childhood dreams. In 2007, he was back in Nepal to start the project\r\n\r\nâ€œBefore I went to Japan, I had no idea about how grapes were grown. Slowly as I visited the countryside I saw a lot of vineyards producing both wine and table grapes. They had learned techniques from the French as they saw a market for wine and I thought why not start one here in Nepal,â€ adds Karki who researched a lot before attempting to open a vineyard.\r\n\r\nBut he realised that a drinking culture hadnâ€™t developed in the country. â€œI was a bit skeptical initially but I then realised that I was creating a niche product and it motivated me to carry on,â€ he adds.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Goro Vineyard at Pataleban Vineyard Resort\r\nHis last few years in Japan was spent researching on winemaking. A friend, Amikura Takuji, who helped him a lot from arranging visits to vineyards in Japan to introducing him to winemakers, played an important role. â€œHis help was invaluable for which Iâ€™ll forever be grateful,â€ adds Karki who shares he even went to a university in Japan to learn more about winemaking from Professor Dr Okamoto Goro.\r\n\r\nâ€œDr Goro helped me a lot too, without his technical expertise I wouldnâ€™t have been able to open this place. He also did a lot of research from which he told me that the weather in Nepalâ€™s hills was ideal for grape farming but also added that we had to do something about the monsoon which would coincide with the harvest season,â€ adds Karki.\r\n\r\nSo with help from this friends and mentors, Karki decided to start this project in 2007 using modern American techniques to cultivate the grapes. Initially, he planted 11 varieties of grapes which such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Koshu and Muscat Bailey.\r\n\r\n\r\nVineyard at Kaule\r\nChallenges\r\nOpening a new business in Nepal isnâ€™t easy, Karki found out. His first challenge was raising funds. â€œIt isnâ€™t easy opening a vineyard in Nepal where people from the government arenâ€™t even aware of what we are,â€ Karki adds.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe bank, while passing our loan, didnâ€™t put us in the â€˜agricultureâ€™ categoryâ€“doing so would have meant a better interest rate for us,â€ he continues. Karki also shares that bank officials, who sit in their air-conditioned offices, didnâ€™t even visit the place once to see if it was an agricultural project or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nKumar Karki at Pataleban Vineyard Resort\r\nAnother hurdle was to make the people aware of the productâ€“ another reason he opened a resort. Pataleban Resort helped promote the product, but Nepalis were still not open to local wine. It was only in 2014 that the vineyard started selling the wines.\r\n\r\nIt normally takes five years to produce wine from scratchâ€“three years for growing grapes, one year for fermentation and one year for storage. â€œThis is not easy if you donâ€™t have something else to bring in some cash.â€\r\n\r\nAnother major challenge was the monsoon which would coincide with the harvest season and that would be a problem as the fruit needs a lot of sunlight to get the sweetness. For that, they tried a lot of things, including early riping techniques which is slowly being put into practice.\r\n\r\nInitial Response\r\nThe first years were not easy but the resort helped a lot as people from the Valley started to visit the resport. Karki says most came to the place because it was a vineyard and were bent on drinking wine\r\n\r\nâ€œIn our first year of operation in 2010, a lot of people came to stay here but during those times the wine wasnâ€™t as refined as it is now but people still drank it and liked it. Now the bigger challenge was to market the product in a manner which would make it a success in Nepal.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first bottles of wine produced from the winery in Pataleban wasnâ€™t very good. But slowly it started to get better and in 2014 they launched their first batch of wine which had around 200 bottles which were received well by the guests who came to stay at the resort.\r\n\r\nScaling Up\r\nHaving successfully cultivated wine at Pataleban, Karki looked to build on his project. In 2011, he bought some land in Kaule, a village in Dhading where he planted more grapes.\r\n\r\nBut he needed help to scale up as producing more wines for that he needed so expertise and in 2014 he stumbled across Swiss Contact, a non-profit organisation which sends retired Swiss professionals to developing countries to help strengthen organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwiss Contact then sent Joseph Chanton, 74, who had been involved in winemaking from a young age. â€œJosephâ€™s help was invaluable he helped me polish the wine I was making. He taught me how Europeans made wine which was different to the style I was using before.\r\n\r\nâ€œHe took me to Europe and showed me how they took care of their vineyards and how to they made wines and he also brought some grapes with him and planted it in Kaule.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nJanapal Thapa and Dhurba Khatri plucking grapes\r\nâ€œThe way we wines were being made here was a bit different. They were growing too many grapes in the same plant which is not good for wines. That is is why I told them that they needed to focus on producing quality rather than quantity,â€ says Chanton who says Karki heeded his advice while plating grapes in Kaule.\r\n\r\nChanton comes to Nepal every year for three months to work in the vineyards. He shares that the wine here is quite good and feels the taste is decent. â€œThere are other wines here that arenâ€™t half as good. I donâ€™t know how they can call themselves a winery when they donâ€™t even have a vineyard,â€ shares Chanton.\r\n\r\n\r\nKewalpur farm seen from kaule\r\nAfter the success of Kaule, Karki decided to open another vineyardâ€“this time on the other side of Kaule at a place called Kewalpur, where he had slowly started buying land from locals. â€œThe number of grapes we were producing wasnâ€™t enough and I wanted to do a bit more and just I bought the land in Kewalpur. The earthquake hit during that time and I was in trouble .â€\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days, Karki looked after everything (the resort, the vineyard). But he realised that running everything alone would be difficult. In 2015, Karki met Janapal Thapa (49) who had been working in the hospitality industry for over two decades and Dhurba Kumar Khatri (49) a friend who had knowledge in the field of marketing and finance. The three of them together decided to run the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing common between the three of them was that all of them had come back from their stints abroad to start something here in Nepal. â€œAll of us got on board quite quickly, and believed that this project would be a success,â€ added Thapa who took over operations of Pataleban Vineyard Resort in 2016 after Banayan Tree Nepal, a company where he is a partner leased the property. Khatriâ€™s people skills and marketing expertise, along with his knowledge, also came in quite handy while marketing the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Future\r\nAfter 11 years of hard work, now the company is looking to move towards launching its wine in the market. The trio, together with Chanton, recently launched their wine in Pokhara and are soon planning to launch it in Kathmandu.\r\n\r\nâ€œThat these restaurants agreed to put our wine on the menu is quite an honour for us as till now not one Nepali wine has been sold there,â€ says Khatri who adds that the quality of the wines was the reason the restaurants agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next few years, the winery is also planning to roll out three new products: two red wines and one white to add to its existing three wines (white, red, rose). â€œThe current wines are all blended and have been received well by the consumers but now we want to do something different,â€ adds Khatri who says there is a market for wines in Nepal. He shares that now they are planning to bring specialist grape wines Solaris(White), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (Red) to the market.\r\n\r\nThe partners also share that this project can be a good example of agro-tourism as it was the case in Japan. â€œDomestic tourism in on the rise and I feel this project, when it is complete, will surely bring a lot of them here,â€ adds Thapa who feels that it will result in employment of many from the area.\r\n\r\n\r\nContainers with wine ready to be bottled\r\nIn the future, the company plans to build a cellar of international standard in Kewalpur and also improve the winery. Thapa shares that they are also planning to build a museum to showcase their wines.\r\n\r\nWith the wine culture in Nepal slowly developing, the need for quality wine will definitely rise as there is a certain romance in wine that other drinks donâ€™t offer. Most wines consumed in the country is imported and with the winery expecting to produce 100,000 bottles a year in the next three years the partners feel that they can displace imported wines in the market soon.\r\n</p>', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-03 08:39:42'),

That is exactly what I felt while going to the forbidden kingdom of upper Mustang. With every mile I passed through the rugged terrain, I couldnâ€™t help but feel that I was a part of an adventurous gameâ€“a game I could win by crossing the finish line and lose by parting with my life.\r\n\r\nAs I looked below, the narrow road sent a shiver down my spine and the tall hills above on which winding snake-like roads nonchalantly crisscrossed made my heart pound every time we approached a narrow bend. Fear crept in and faded away throughout the journey. But that did not stop me from wanting stop in front of the small streams and waterfalls we passed by. Our track ahead felt like it had been paved by a bolt of lightning.\r\n\r\nBut as I was there to enjoy a part of Nepal I hadnâ€™t visited, I suppressed my fear and decided to take it all in. As soon as I stopped being afraid, I felt that this part of the land was indeed one of Nepalâ€™s true gems, a place that hasnâ€™t been marketed enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Mustang is a place that is rich in both natural beauty and history. I was so elated by its beauty that a part of me didnâ€™t want to leave.\r\n\r\nDue to its remoteness and the absence of natural resources, upper Mustang remained in the shadow until 1992 when it was first opened for tourism. As soon as tourists started coming to this place, It developed at a brisk pace and its cultural and economic landscape evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe â€˜timeless placeâ€™ that somehow escaped the wrath of development was a place where the peoples still nurtured a close relationship with the land. It still is a place that is both pristine and primitive, and thus beautiful. Upper Mustang has been overly mystified in one too many travel journals.\r\n\r\nThis area didnâ€™t have roads before 1992, and if you look at the paths closely, they arenâ€™t actually roads. That these tracks do exist nowadays is a great thing because over these years the area has seen a rise in domestic tourismâ€“something the people of the place hadnâ€™t dreamed of in the mid-90s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParts of the road that leads to upper Mustang arenâ€™t the best, for example, the stretch between Chusang, Samar and Bhenka Danda is in a miserable state.\r\n\r\nRoads from Jomson take you up to the China border in Korala but they arenâ€™t the best as construction works are continuously going on. The most dangerous part of the trip was crossing the Kali Gandaki River, which during the monsoon isnâ€™t the easiest thing to do. But a bridge is being built here too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocals are hopeful that when the the roads get better, more tourists will come. â€œWe have been taking around 2-3 groups of domestic tourists to upper Mustang. But due to the condition of the roads, most people are very afraid to get here,â€ adds Mahendra Gurung who runs a tourism business in the region.\r\n\r\nHe further mentions that the place is ideal for those who love adventure because these roads arenâ€™t for the faint-hearted.', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-03 08:52:14'),
(36, 'Blog', 'Why Nepalâ€™s tourism industry needs more affordable hostels than expensive hotels', 'Wander-Thirst-2.jpg', 'Source: Wander Thirst Hostels\r\nJames Walker visits Nepal for a month every few years to take a break from his hectic life in the United States. He always prefers to stay in Thamel because it was where he first stayed back in the 80s. But two years ago, everything changed when he decided to walk to Swayambhu rather than take a cab.\r\n\r\nâ€œI always took a cab there but that day I donâ€™t know what happened I wanted to walk and then is when I discovered all these different hostels around the Paknajol area,â€ says Walker, who adds he was shocked to see so many tourist hostels in the area.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, there has be a rise is these hostels in the area which have been a revelation for backpackers. â€œMost come here on a tight budget. Not all come here to have a fun. Some come here as an escape from their daily life,â€ adds Walker, saying he stays at a hostel named Zostel every time he visits Kathmandu these days.\r\n\r\nHostel Vs Hotel\r\nStaying in a hostel will save you huge amounts of money, but the main reason people stay in hostels isnâ€™t the price, itâ€™s the people. The social atmosphere in hostels is totally unique, and itâ€™s what makes â€˜hostellingâ€™ so addictive. It can transform oneâ€™s trip from a sightseeing tour into a more meaningful experience.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a place where one can meet new friends from all over the world. Youâ€™ll cook together, drink together, and go on adventures together.\r\n\r\nValue For Money\r\nOne of the prime reasons these hostels have gained popularity is they are cheap. Any hotels around Thamel will at least charge tourists $10 for a night which is double the price of many hostels in the area.\r\n\r\nMost of these hostels have bunk beds like those found in Amsterdam and are safe and secure. Some even have private rooms for those who want their privacy. They offer services like kitchen, laundry and a few also have travel desk which makes the tourists feel at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Wander Thirst Hostels\r\nâ€œOne of the reasons hostels have been successful is also the rise of backpackers in Nepal,â€ adds Dhurba Raj Sapkota, Manager of Wander Thirst Hostels. â€œThamel has become really expensive for tourists. With many hotels not giving attention to details, it has resulted in tourists not going there,â€ he continues.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe fact that we offer many services for a reduced price makes us value for money. Like, during off seasons, we always give tourists a complimentary service including breakfasts and dinners which adds some value to our service,â€ adds Sapkota.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Shantipur Hostel\r\nIt is quite true. Over the last decade, Thamel has become really expensive for both Nepalis and tourists alike. Nepal has been marketed as a cheap destination but if one looks around Thamel, it isnâ€™t so cheap. Plus, the price one pays for the rooms doesnâ€™t match the qualityâ€“a reason why most backpackers prefer to pay $3-$5 and stay at a hostel than pay $10 and stay at a hotel.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe first time I stayed at Shantipur, it only cost me $4 and that included breakfast,â€ adds Walker who says he was quite shocked at the price they were charging. But soon, he found better options around Thamel.', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-03 08:54:01'),

He always prefers to stay in Thamel because it was where he first stayed back in the 80s. But two years ago, eve', 'working-the-rapids.jpg', 'Exclusively used for scientific surveys, fishery biologists employ electro-fishing as the most humane way of catching fish, before releasing them back into the wild.\r\nFishing has always been an abiding passion for me. So, I jumped at the idea of a fishing trip (some seven years back) to Roshi Khola (river) when my teammates planned it. It was, however, a different kind of fishingâ€“electro-fishing to be more exact. And it was more a mission than a fun trip.\r\n\r\nElectro-fishing is a scientific process of stunning fish by using electric current powered by a portable backpack generator or battery. The current is delivered by a pair of electrodes that comes with the equipment. Exclusively used for scientific surveys, fishery biologists use it as the most humane way of catching fish, before releasing them back into the wild.\r\n\r\nOur purpose too was a scientific survey aimed at determining the fish abundance, density and species composition of the Roshi River. We had to catch fish to carry out our mission. Electro-fishing, when done properly, results in no permanent harm to fish.\r\n\r\nSadly, to the detriment of our aquatic life, for the past decade, people invented crude replicas of this equipment for the indiscriminate and unethical killing of fish on a mass scale for eating and selling, which has reached epidemic proportions the length and breadth of our country.\r\n\r\nWe were five in all, Arun, Vikas, Kumar, and I. Professor Bibhuti Ranjan Jha was a guest and our mentor. Everybody addressed him as Jha Sir, so he was â€˜Jha Sirâ€™ to all.  A senior environment scientist at Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel, he had volunteered to join us as our â€˜guruâ€™.  The equipment and all the paraphernalia for the survey were provided courtesy of Jha Sir.\r\n\r\nIt was almost noon when we arrived at the Roshi Bridge via the Banepa-Sindhuli Highway. As we sped along the new highway (paved only up to Nepalthok then), all eyes turned to the clear Roshi after it appeared as we crossed a bridge over it. The Roshi tumbled past rocks and boulders strewn all along the watercourse as it snaked through the narrow valley.\r\n\r\nThe river Roshi is named after a tiny village (Roshi Gaon) located on a hillside some three kilometres from the old historical Newar town of Panauti, seven kilometres south-east of Banepa.\r\n\r\nNoted once for delectable asla (snow trout), the spring-fed river drains from the high Phulchoki hills (above Godavari), and converges on the Sun Koshi river at a small settlement called Dumja (on the Sindhuli-Bardibas highway), some 55 km from Dhulikhel.\r\n\r\nThe Roshi today, however, stands depleted and degraded. Over-fishing (electro-fishing included), burgeoning settlement, development works (during the highway construction), and massive excavation of sand, gravel, and boulders has violated the once pristine river.\r\n\r\nExcept for Professor Jha, all four of us (avid anglers) represented an NGO involved in the conservation of aquatic resources of our country.\r\n\r\nAs we drove down the highway surveying the river that flanked the road, we passed by a stone-crushing site by the riverside. The gin-clear Roshi after that point turned disbelievingly turbid and continued that wayâ€”getting worse as a few kilometres down another plant spewed silted water into it.\r\n\r\nAt a place called Dumja, the lesser Roshi finally merged with the robust Sun Koshi River at Dumja. It was shocking to watch the dark chocolate Roshi in stark contrast to the turquoise water of Sun Koshi as it tumbled into the big river.\r\n\r\nOur survey began at the Roshi a little farther up Nepalthok where the water was clear and unsoiled by the stone crushing factories. The balmy day with the sun not too strong promised an agreeable weather. Without further ado, our team pitched into work. Care had to be taken as the riverbed was uneven with slippery gravel and stones.\r\n\r\nOff went the foursome (Kumar, Arun, Vikas and Jha sir) into the Roshi, knee-deep (waist-deep some places), struggling against the current upstream. Kumar, weighed down by a bulky generator on his back, clumsily waded through the water holding the ominous looking stick with the electrodes, which he kept poking into the water while his other hand fiddled with a switch that delivered an electric current.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArun and Vikash in unwieldy waders flanked Kumar, holding long staffs attached to dip nets. The work began and the duo started jabbing the staffs left and right to trap the stunned fish. Prof Jha brought up the rear with a plastic bucket that held the fish netted by Arun and Vikash. All were wearing chest long mandatory rubber waders (with boots attached) to avoid the risk of getting electrocuted.\r\n\r\nI elected myself to be the team-photographer and no less excited than my colleagues, clicked furiously on my Canon G-9 from the banks. At first sight, it looked like total bedlam, a bunch of weirdly outfitted guys working the river with long staffs in frenzy.\r\n\r\nâ€œHey, try that eddyâ€¦no, no not that one, the one on your right,â€ an over-excited Arun bellowed at Kumar. â€œShove the stick deeper. Try to reach underneath the big bouldersâ€. Everyone had to yell over the sound of the rushing water. Now it was Vikashâ€™s turn to shout: â€œThere, there . . . Arun, the fish are to your left.â€\r\n\r\nProfessor Jha apart, the young men (in their early thirties then) launched themselves into a raucous bubbling energy, worth watching.  Excitement mounted with the passing of every minute.\r\n\r\nWords flew. The yelling took newer heights. As expected, the entire scene of frenetic activity coupled with the noise successfully drew a small local crowd, who watched in awed silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, when only five minutes remained to complete the first leg of the operation (15 to 20 minutes to be done at 2 different stretches), the generator coughed, sputtered, belched out black smoke, and died to everybodyâ€™s,  â€œOh, no!â€\r\n\r\nDespite several attempts, the gen-set refused to budge.  All four reluctantly waded out the river.  And then, Vikash stumbled, lost his footing, and crashed into the water followed by a burst of guffawing from the gathered local crowd.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the gen-set had its spark plug fouled.  A quick scrubbing of the plug did the work, though and the gen-set kick-started to everybodyâ€™s . . . â€œHurrayâ€! Since that particular stretch was already disturbed, we worked up from a different spot downriver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was time for a lunch break. We helped ourselves to hefty tuna sandwichesâ€“by courtesy of Arun. After a lip-smacking lunch and a bottle of chilled Coke, we all got down to the final work. An excited Kumar checked on the dayâ€™s catch stowed in two different buckets.\r\n\r\nAs it appeared, the last combing operation had yielded more fish, finger size and smaller. Every fish had to be taxonomically categorised by its native identification, scientific name, weight and length. The total count of each species assessed its abundance in the river.\r\n\r\nI took a little time off to satisfy some of the local fellowsâ€™ curiosities. A local fisherman with a cast-net slung over his shoulder seemed the most inquisitive. After I explained to him about our survey, I asked him: â€œSo, how is your fishing going on?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œVery little, sir; itâ€™s not like what it used to be. Ten years ago, my cast-net brought enough fish to support my family. There are no fish in Roshi, today.  I fish these days in my spare time only, doing odd jobs to earn my bread,â€ lamented Krishna, the local fisherman.\r\n\r\nOf the eight different species captured, totaling 214, Bhote Gadelo, a loach (Schistura Rupecula), had the highest abundance (106 total count); next were, Katle, copper mahseer (Neolissocheilus hexagonolopis):53, and Buche Aasla, Bluntâ€“nosed Snow trout, (Shizothorax richardsonii):12, to name a few.\r\n\r\nNone of the catch, disappointingly, included the Golden Mahseer, tor putitora, (the most-coveted fish by the anglers) although the spring-fed Roshi offered adequate rocks, pebbles and gravel bedsâ€”a perfect spawning ground for this species from the Sunkoshi River.  â€œDarn it!â€ snorted Vikash to show his frustration.\r\n\r\nIt was time for the fish to be released. Arun volunteered and grinned from ear to ear at the camera. The locals watched in awe; bewildered (although we had explained) at the entire catch being released.\r\n\r\nDarkness approached while we packed up for the day. We shook hands with Krishna and the local bunch, who kept us company to the last bit, and piled into Arunâ€™s battered old jeep (almost 30 years old!) that screeched and groaned with faults in every conceivable part.\r\n\r\nA little later, as we crossed the Roshi Bridge, I looked back at the river to find in the fading light a streak of silver that wound its path across the darkening valley, as gentler hills stood out on two sides in somber silhouettes. We really had a fantastic day of fishing . . . and for a good cause, I mused.', 1, 'Ujit', '2018-08-03 08:55:52');
